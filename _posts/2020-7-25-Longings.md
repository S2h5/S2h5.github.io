“Let’s run away together,  
away from city lights,  
where no one knows our name yet,  
And we can see the stars at night,  
we’ll camp out in the open,  
warming cold skin by the fire,  
Tell each other hopes and dreams,  
And all of our desires,  
we’ll own nothing more than we need,  
watch sunrise color the sky,  
Learn what we’re really here for,  
Away from society’s eyes,  
This journey will be scary,  
But we’ll leave without a plan,  
And I know it will be alright,  
As long as you’re holding my hand.”
